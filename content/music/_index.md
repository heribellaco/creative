The songs have been written in the last 5 years, with pieces of guitar recorded and edited on Adobe Audition, or recorded directly to my phone. This bits and pieces were imported to LogicPro software where voice, bass, keyboards and drums were added, and finally mixed and mastered.

The songs where put togeter with intros, outros, and divided in choruses, verses, bridges, etc. Finally lyrics where added; the beats per minute (BPM), and the key used found. Inspiration came from various sources.

* 80 & 90 Rock.
* Pop Rock and Romantic Ballads.
* Clasic guitar and folk.

All the music is written, played and singed by me.
