## Animal Garden Album

The songs have been written in the last 3 years, with pieces of guitar sections recorded with Adobe Audition mainly, but sometimes with LogicPro software or recorded directly to my phone and edited later.

The pieces where put togeter with intros, outros, and divided in choruses, verses, bridges, etcetera. Finally lyrics where added, the beats per minute(BPM) found, and the key used when possible. Inspiration came from various sources.

* 90 Rock & Progressive Rock.
* Romantic Ballads.
* Clasical music and jazz.
