## Animal Garden Album

The songs have been written in the last 3 years, with pieces of guitar recorded and edited on Adobe Audition mainly, or recorded directly to my phone. This bits and pieces were later rerecorded and imported to LogicPro software where voice, bass, keboards and drums were added, and finally mixed and mastered by myself.

The pieces where put togeter with intros, outros, and divided in choruses, verses, bridges, etcetera. Finally lyrics where added, the beats per minute(BPM) were found, and the key used when possible. Inspiration came from various sources.

* 90 Rock & Progressive Rock.
* Pop and Romantic Ballads.
* Clasical music and jazz.

All the music playing and singing is done by myself.
