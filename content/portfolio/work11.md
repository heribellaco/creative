The image is called "Keratoconus Breakfast", and shows on one side a table and on the left the distorted image that we see without lenses.

An apple with a keratoconus scan image surface is placed at the table to remind us that we are part of nature.

1. Apple was rendered with Cinema4d Software and texture taken directly from my eye's Orbscan.
2. Brekfast image taken with my Olympus camara, blurring and apple added later with Adobe photoshop.
