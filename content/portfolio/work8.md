This is my book blog page
<!--more-->

This blog page is used as a complement of my book "the keratoconus user-guide", it contains articles about ideas discussed in the book, but additional material of interest to my readers.

This blog is a static blog meaning it has no database and can be hosted practically for free, it is build with Hugo ststic page generator and hosted in Github and deployed by Netlify.

1. Static pages load faster.
2. Easy to create and maintain.
3. Almost free to host(no php).
4. Ideal for small personal proyects.
