This is my book blog page, it is used as a addon to my book "the keratoconus user-guide"

<!--more-->

This blog page contains articles about ideas discussed in the book, but additional material and information of interest to my readers.

This blog is a static blog, meaning it is fast, has no database and can be hosted practically for free; it is build with the Hugo static page generator, hosted in Github and deployed by Netlify.

1. Static pages load faster.
2. Easy to create and maintain.
3. Almost free to host (no php).
4. No plug-ins just html, css and some jaxascript.
4. Ideal for small personal proyects.
