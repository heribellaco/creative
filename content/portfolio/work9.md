This cover represents the world as we see it, from the sunny side of mountain like in the Chinese yin/yang tradition; but if we climb more we can find ourselves in the shadowy side of the world; may be in a better site, but also advancing to the unknown and, maybe a more dangerous place.

This world variety is represented by the Chinese tigers, the Indian Ganesh elephant, the chee-kung balls, the cairne, coins, and mexican mortar called "molcajete".

The garden Items remind us of how big the world is, and the incredible adventure that being alive represent.

## Animal Garden Album

The songs have been written in the last 3 years from pieces of guitar parts recorded with Adobe Audition mainly, but sometimes with LogicProX software on my mac or recorded directly to my phone.

The pieces where put togeter with intros, outros, and divided in Choruses, Verses, Bridges, etcetera. Finally lyrics where added, the beats per minute (BPM)found and the key used when possible. Inspiration came from various sources.

* 90 Rock & Progressive Rock.
* Romantic Ballads.
